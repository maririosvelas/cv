 <h1>family</h1>
 <p>
   Im gonna tell the time when I accidentality damaged my phone! It all started when I broke my phone’s screen. I was fidgeting with my phone case and accidentally took it off, then it fell to the ground and the screen broke! (Its an important detail for later) The story continues when I was in the car with my best friends on our way to a house in the countryside for my friend's birthday. I had my phone on my lap, and my friends had the amazing idea that every time we did a curve, we will throw into the friends on that side. Then things got a little out of hand and we were all staked on tope of each other, what I came to know after is that my phone was under it all! And the pleasure convinced with the cracks damaged the display!
